                <p>During my time as a support engineer I have used multiple Call Management systems,&nbsp;These have been as simple as no
                call system just using emails,&nbsp; which in my experience does not enable a comprehensive method of transferring
                calls.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through to Complex modern Web based Call management systems such as My Oracle Support (MOS).
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Not forgetting primitive Disk Operating System (DOS) based system such as Servasure to name but a
                few.&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is I am able to learn new technologies as and when required.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another common factor
                of my support roles is I am comfortable speaking to Non-Technical users through to Technically Advanced Developers and
                usually translating between the different technical Levels.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="id2" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel">
                <p>At Indigo 4 Systems Ltd (2000&nbsp; -&nbsp; 2004),&nbsp; my role was as a Support&nbsp;&nbsp; Programmer this meant that
                for two weeks I would code (FoxPro,&nbsp; C# or VB) once I completed a module I would test a colleagues while they
                tested mine.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp; the impact was greater in the Support element because while doing support for
                the product then we had access to the source code which gave context to a totally nonsensical problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
                context meant that we could ask the right questions to identify the actual problem and ultimately reach a quick
                solution.
                </p><p>At Torex Retail Systems Ltd (2008&nbsp; -&nbsp; 2012),&nbsp; In comparison this was a purely Support role where access
                to source code wasn't given,&nbsp; which made resolving issues longer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because in the event that the source
                code was required,&nbsp; it would be necessary to contact Development who once they got round to your call would answer
                the question (in a fashion). &nbsp;&nbsp; This employment required that we would have to learn approx 3 systems to
                support these sytems which included Electronic Point Of Sale (EPOS) & &nbsp;Back Office (BO) Systems which were both
                console & web based applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;Torex was absorbed into Micros Retail Systems (2012&nbsp; -&nbsp;
                2014),&nbsp;finally Oracle Retail UK (2012&nbsp; -&nbsp; 2022).</p>

                <p>The Oracle phase of my Software support Experience added a further dimension this was to change the context from
                supporting UK Retailers to supporting global businesses,&nbsp; Introducing working methodologies such as chasing the
                sun,&nbsp; which means that as you go off shift then the call is passed onto someone who is coming on shift usually in a
                different timezone.&nbsp;&nbsp;So technically a call could be worked 24&nbsp;/&nbsp;7.&nbsp&nbspThis phase of the
                employment also saw me elevated to Oracles equivelant of a 3<sup>rd</sup> Line Support Engineer.
