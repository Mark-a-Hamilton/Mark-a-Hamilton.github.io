            <div id="oview" class="tab-pane fade show active" role="tabpanel">
                <p>Most of my IT career has been spent in support, as a result this has given me an insight into the
                    perception from both the Customer & supplier where each has multiple levels (see the Customer &
                    Supplier Tabs). The main difference is that the Customer is on the whole IT Illiterate unlike the
                    Supplier. As a result this means that the Customer just wants a working software system while the
                    development team is more concerned with getting the software up and running.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="customer" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel">
                <p>There are 3 Basic types of Customer though this will vary depending on the size of the operation
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Business Owners </b>Are mainly concerned with returning the most profits with as little
                        outlay as possible. This, also involves IT systems and unfortunately the business owners also
                        hold the purse strings.</li>
                    <li><b>Managers / Supervisors </b>Are mainly concerned with hitting targets, as they have the
                        business owners chasing for results. It is fair to say that some (though not all) are bullies,
                        which means in some circumstances they believe that the louder you shout the more things will
                        get done. In short this breed of manager / supervisor has no people skills, meaning as a support
                        engineer I soon developed a thick skin and learned how to deal with such attitudes.</li>
                    <li><b>Staff / Sales Assistants </b>Ironically these are the users of a software system, have no
                        control over the system and suffer the frustration if theres a problem due to a lack of
                        understanding the problem. Also having their manager and/or supervisor trying to get them to
                        make the system work adds to the pressure.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="supplier" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel">
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Sales Staff </b>are usually on commission / performance based pay to encourage sales. This
                        results in empty promises, so in short customers make a request and sales staff will agree with
                        the customer just to make a sale. As a support engineer I've had complaints from customers when
                        they were promised functionality would be done but it hasn't.</li>
                    <li><b>Developers </b>are solely focussed on the software product.</li>
                    <li><b>Support </b>I accept my view is biased but it seems support are responsible for picking up
                        the pieces.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="strategy" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel">
                <p>The Deployment Strategy initially is to keep the hardware (computer) Healthy and to make the software
                    as efficient as possible, By doing the Windows only (free) steps will prevent most performance
                    related software support calls. Having said that by also including 3rd Party software will reduce
                    the support calls even more. This strategy focuses on maintaining the Health of the PC which I
                    believe is overlooked and underestimated by development teams.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="windows" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel">
                <p>Assuming the software will be deployed on a windows based platform there are several tools which can
                    be used in order to provide a minimum maintenance strategy with little impact on the supplier these
                    tools are, bearing in mind alot of support calls may be resolved by basic maintenance setting up a
                    machine will prevent such support calls :-
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Task Scheduler </b>enables maintenance to be done automatically meaning each machine can be
                        configured based on the Business requirements.</li>
                    <li><b>Disk Defragmenter </b>should be scheduled Daily, note the more frequent it is scheduled the
                        less there is to do, Optimizing the HDD regularly. </li>
                    <li><b>Disk Cleanup Manager </b>should be scheduled daily, note the more frequent it is scheduled
                        the less there is to do, Meaning unwanted files will be removed regularly.</li>
                    <li><b>Restart </b>by scheduling the "shutdown -r" command at an appropriate time ensures the
                        machine will be regularly restarted, Releasing memory on a regular basis.</li>
                    <li><b>Security & Maintenance Section </b>should be enabled within Windows.</li>
                    <li><b>Windows Defender </b>Should be enabled and configured within Windows, Basic antivirus (Better
                        than nothing).</li>
                    <li><b>Automatic Windows Updates </b>should be configured to run automatically, keeping the
                        operating system up to date.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="3rdpty" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel">
                <p>There are 3rd party software titles which do more than the Windows Maintenance having said that they
                    are usually chargeble, not limited to but some titles are :-
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Avira AV </b>More advanced AV software takes precedence over Windows Defender.</li>
                    <li><b>CCleaner </b>More in Depth software to keep the PC healthy.</li>
                    <li><b>Ease Us Suite </b>Several Utilities again to keep the PC healthy.</li>
                </ol>
                It is Advised to review all the 3rd Party tools establishing the best value to be deployed with the
                sofware, as 3<sup>rd</sup> Party Software Providers will usually require a charge or donation.
