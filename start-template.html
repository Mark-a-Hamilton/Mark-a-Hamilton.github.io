                    The purpose of the Templates Solution is to provide a starting point for future projects, depending on the agreed standards. The Templates Solution contains several different templates, these are :-

                        <li><b>&ensp;Application&ensp;-&ensp;</b>The Application template incorporates the MVC framework with <a href="https://serilog.net/" target="_blank">Serilog</a> for logging, MS SQL Server database, not forgetting global exception handling, etc.&ensp;For further information see the "App" tab.</li>
                        <li><b>&ensp;Minimal API&ensp;-&ensp;</b>.&ensp;This is one of the other startup Project and deals with Database access using <a

                        <li><b>&ensp;Unit Testing&ensp;-&ensp;</b>The Unit Testing Template uses <a href="https://fluentassertions.com/introduction"
                            target="_blank">Fluent Assertions</a> framework to test the application Project.&ensp;For further information see the "Unit Testing" tab.</li>

                <p><b>Status - Done.<br>FrameWork - Models-Views-Controllers (MVC) Project</b><br>It is fair to say that
                    the MVC framework can be used to do all the tasks required in a project having said that the purpose
                    of the "App Project" is to act as a <b>start-up project and hub</b> so that everything goes through
                    the app but elements such as database access, logging & testing are done by specialist projects as
                    and when required which provides consistency throughout solutions and projects within the solution.
                    The App project contains the Models which can be created from either an existing database or from
                    code.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="api" role="tabpanel">
                <p><b>&ensp;Status&ensp;-&ensp;Done</b><br><b>&ensp;Framework&ensp;-&ensp;Web API Project</b><br>The purpose of the Minimal Application
                    Programmable Interface is to provide a mechanism by which a request can be made to the database
                    securely. Without giving access to the database or divulging its structure unnecessarily, meaning
                    you are in control of the Data source.  Especially, as the Project uses Swagger then the API calls can be tested and documneted in development mode, Each API can be as open or restricted as necessary to perform the required tasks for example a minimal API's can be produced for the same product with an Internal version for support and an External version a public user, thus ultimately protecting the database from malicious intent.</p>

                <p><b>&ensp;Status&ensp;-&ensp;Done</b><br>Serilog has been used to replace the built in logger because it is
                    more Flexible and better logging descriptions.
                <ul>
                    <li>&ensp;<b>Overview&ensp;-&ensp;</b>The App project is configured to read the configuration settings so as long as
                        the appropriate Sink package is installed and the configuration is done then the logging will be
                        done. Note all HTTP requests are logged automatically without the need to include the log
                        entries in each controller.</li>
                    <li>&ensp;<b>Sinks&ensp;-&ensp;</b>The main Sink (Serilog.Sinks.{Destination}) packages are below but the
                        examples below are not exhaustive if your requirement is not accomodated below check the
                        Serilog Documentation. some of the common Destinations are below :-
                        <ol>
                            <li>&ensp;<b>Console&ensp;-&ensp;</b>Command Console Window.</li>
                            <li>&ensp;<b>Debug&ensp;-&ensp;</b>Debug Window.</li>
                            <li>&ensp;<b>EventLog&ensp;-&ensp;</b>Directly To the Windows Event Viewer.</li>
                            <li>&ensp;<b>Email&ensp;-&ensp;</b>a nominated Email address.</li>
                            <li>&ensp;<b>File&ensp;-&ensp;</b>A Text file in either Text or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
                                format.</li>
                            <li>&ensp;<b>MSSQLServer&ensp;-&ensp;</b>MS SQL Server Database.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>&ensp;<b>Configuration&ensp;-&ensp;</b>All the Destination Packages can be configured independently in
                        appsettings.json, or its environment variable equivalent. This adds to the flexibility
                        of Serilog, My personal approach is to use the environment appsettings file for
                        configuration that is necessary for the solution while the appsettings.json file is used
                        solely for the user options configuration.</li>
                </ul>
                The Logging project means that everything can be pre-defined and the development team only has to
                deal with making the log entries in the solution.</p>

                <p><b>Status - Done.<br>FrameWork - Xunit Project</b><br>In order to fully understand Unit Testing (UT)
                    it is necessary to understand the basic principles of UT. Testing has always been done in the
                    Software development lifecycle UT is only one of the Later strategies <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>History of Testing </b>initially testing was done using Dry Runs (pen and paper) very
                        monotonous, laborious and time-consuming, as a result not very efficient. This was later
                        improved in an attempt to auromate the process be writing specific methods to call the relevant
                        method and test the output. This approach was the predecessor to UT as we know it.</li>
                    <li><b>Analogy of Software defences </b>it is reasonable to compare software protection with an
                        animal such as a crustacion, shell-fish or insect. Which all have protective outer layers and
                        soft (vulnerable) insides. This strategy is also employed by the military for example armoured
                        vehicles to protect the vulnerable service-personnel. The Job of the User Interface (UI) is to
                        act as that hard exterior in order to protect the vulnerable Operating System (OS) this is where
                        UT comes in.</li>
                    <li><b>Software Vulnerabilities </b>Unscrupulous programmers use various means to exploit software
                        by using methods which are in line with computer rules but the software was not designed to deal
                        with causing the software to crash providing a chink in the armour of the UI enabling the
                        Software to be exploited, Such common methods are SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, One-up
                        One-down vulnerabilities to name but a few. As a result UT is a tool used to protect the
                        software. This raisess the question how can we use UT to protect software <br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>&ensp;<b>Specification </b>all methods to be tested should be defined in the specification as
                                a result each test can be wrote before the method being tested so the test is wrote to
                                the specification NOT the method.</li>
                            <li>&ensp;<b>Method </b>once the method has been wrote and complies with the test, The test can be
                                revised by inspecting the source-code with a view to breaking the method (previously
                                known as Testing to Destruction). All appropriate validation can be implemented as
                                required in the method and test, tightening up any loose ends so to speak.</li>
                            <li>&ensp;<b>Example of validation </b>the functionality to add two integers is really straight
                                forward or so you might think "number1 + number2" however it is possible that the
                                equation will not work because the computer has a Maximum value so such validation could
                                be done to ensure the calculation is correct by introducing a 3rd variable so "total =
                                number1 + number2" the validation could then be "if (number2 != total - number1) throw
                                exception" the test would be changed to ensure the appropriate exception is thrown.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Balanced Approached - </b>Tests should be wrote for methods which originate in the product
                        and are dynamic(Can be changed)
                        specification which outlines the parameters of the associated method. Only dynamic internal(Not
                        external Libraries or Frameworks) methods should be tested.</li>
                    <li><b>Encourage Good Coding Practices - </b>Unit Tests should only be done on methods which are
                        Testable (one unit of work meaning a method which in the past did several units of work then
                        that method is not testable, however by breaking the method down into manageable components each
                        component can be tested. As a result the quality of code is improved.</li>
                    <li><b>Expose Security Vulnerabilities - </b>The most common secutity vulnerability is the "one up,
                        one down vulnerability" which in short enables code to be exploited when for example a loop does
                        one too many or few iterations, if these can be exposed then the software is inherently more
                        secure.</li>
                    <li><b>Expose newly introduced problems - </b> If a change causes a test to fail this draws
                        attention to the change and means that both the test and change should be reviewwed as the test
                        may be too strict or the change does in fact take the method outside of the specified parameters
                        of the method meaning that potential issues are exposed. Whereby in the past this would have
                        been missed.</li>
                </ul>
                This Project approaches testing by having 2 Example Tests (1 Fact & 1 Theory) and is wired up to the app
                project it uses <a href="https://fluentassertions.com/introduction" target="_blank">Fluent
                    Assertions</a> to define the criteria meaning that this is a good starting point for Unit Testing in
                any future project also don't forget to update the GlobalUsings.cs to include new projects and/or
                folders as required. To run you just have to "Run All Tests" from the "Test" menu and view the result in
                the Test Explorer. Fluent assertions provides meaningful results when run.
                </p>
                <p>The Naming convention of unit testing is a s below
                <ol>
                    <li>&ensp;<b>Unit Testing Project&ensp;-&ensp;</b>This is simply called Unit Testing.</li>
                    <li>&ensp;<b>Project being tested&ensp;-&ensp;</b>This is a new folder called "UT.{Projectname}".</li>
                    <li>&ensp;<b>Class being tested&ensp;-&ensp;</b>A Class be created within the project folder called
                        "{ClassName}Tests". </li>
                    <li>&ensp;<b>Method being Tested&ensp;-&ensp;</b>a method should be created with the name
                        "{methodname}_{ReturnType}" this ensures all overloads can be tested independently.</li>
                </ol>
                The above naming convention allows a structure to the tests and indicates exactly what is being tested
                in the results making life easier for developers. If you are new to Unit Testing I would suggest you
                view a youtube video in conjunction with the examples in the start-template.UnitTesting project.
