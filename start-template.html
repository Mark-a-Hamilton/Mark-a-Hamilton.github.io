                <p>The following assumptions have been made, These are :-
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 - </b>Has been installed.</li>
                    <li><b>Microssoft SQL Server - </b>Has been installed.</li>
                    <li><b>Microssoft SQL Server Management Studio - </b>Has been installed.</li>
                    <li>You are familiar with the installed software.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the solution is to provide a starting point for future projects the aim of this
                    solution is to save it as a template for Visual Studio so that template can then be used to create a
                    new solution with all the bells and whistles without the need to make any standard changes. That is
                    to say software has various default elements which have to be implemented everytime with the default
                    templates by creating a customised template this extra work can be eliminated. It is worth noting
                    however that this solution will not suit evrey situation and as a result it is advisable to review
                    the functionality and adapt it to your requirements as required.
                </p>
                <p>For more information on the solution see the solutions tab.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="solution" role="tabpanel">
                <p><b>Status - To Do</b><br>Software essentially requires 4 distinct elements, using the concept of
                    separation of Responsibilities it is good practice to have a separate project for each
                    responsibility resulting in the following 4 projects per solution :-
                <ol>
                    <li><b>App Project - </b>This is the startup Project and deals with the main application set up
                        including Models Functionality & Views. </li>
                    <li><b>API Project - </b>This deals with database connectivity, and CRUD operations using ReSTful
                        Services.</li>
                    <li><b>Logging Project - </b>This Deals with all aspects of logging including connecting to the Log
                        Database. Global Exception Handling, Other log events which means that all logging in a solution
                        is consistant.</li>
                    <li><b>Unit Testing Project - </b>To Deal with all Unit Testing within the Project which is an
                        important element because these provide a quick reliable check to ensure the methods tested
                        remain in the Parameters of the specification.</li>
                </ol>
                It is worth noting that an alternative is to include the functionality into the "App project" However,
                it is common practice to enable 3rd parties to access the database using the API project as being an
                interface this keeps the database secure. Not forgetting that there can be different teams working on
                the different projects simultaneously without the risk of "stepping on each others toes" (To coin a
                phrase). Also, when the website is run it is necessary to load and render the project so if we have the
                app Project doing the bare minimum then this will at least give the perception of improved performance.

                <p><b>Status - To Do.</b><br><b>FrameWork - Web API Project</b><br>The purpose of the Application Programmable Interface is to provide a facility by which a request can be made to the database securely. Without giving access to the database or divulging its structure unnecessarily, meaning you are in control of the Data. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="log" role="tabpanel">
                <p><b>Status - To Do.</b><br>Logging has 3 main components these are :-
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Connecting to the logging Media - </b>This includes defining the logging database connection
                        string which if the database does not exist it will create the database and subsequently the
                        "Log" table automatically while remaining totally divorced from the main app meaning the log can
                        reside on a different server to the Data again ensuring data security.</li>
                    <li><b>Global Exception Handling - </b>This ensures that all Exceptions will be handled consistently
                        throughout the solution wherever the exception is thrown</li>
                    <li><b>Global Logging - </b>This again ensures that all the logging is consistent throughout the
                        solution. </li>
                </ol>The Logging project means that everything can be pre-defined and the development team only has to
                deal with making the log entries in the solution.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="utest" role="tabpanel">
                <p><b>Status - Done.</b><br><b>FrameWork - Xunit Project</b><br>Testing has been a major part of software development from day 1 however,
                    testing methodologies has changed. What are the advantages of Unit Testing?
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Balanced Approached - </b>Tests should be wrote ahead of the source code from the
                        specification which outlines the parameters of the associated method. Only dynamic(Can be
                        changed) internal(Not external Libraries or Frameworks) methods should be tested.</li>
                    <li><b>Encourage Good Coding Practices - </b>Unit Tests should only be done on methods which are
                        Testable (one unit of work), meaning a method which in the past did several units of work then
                        that method is not testable, however by breaking the method down into manageable components each
                        component can be tested. As a result the quality of code is improved.</li>
                    <li><b>Expose Security Vulnerabilities - </b>The most common secutity vulnerability is the "one up,
                        one down vulnerability" which in short enables code to be exploited when for example a loop does
                        one too many or few iterations, if these can be exposed then the software is inherently more
                        secure.</li>
                    <li><b>Expose newly introduced problems - </b> If a change causes a test to fail this draws
                        attention to the change and means that both the test and change should be reviewwed as the test
                        may be too strict or the change does in fact take the method outside of the specified parameters
                        of the method meaning that potential issues are exposed. Whereby in the past this would have
                        been missed.</li>
                </ol>
                This Project approaches testing by having 2 Example Tests (1 Fact & 1 Theory) and is wired up to the app
                project it uses <a href="https://fluentassertions.com/introduction" target="_blank">Fluent
                    Assertions</a> to define the criteria meaning that this is a good starting point for Unit Testing in
                any future project also don't forget to update the GlobalUsings.cs to include new projects and/or
                folders as required. To run you just have to "Run All Tests" from the "Test" menu and view the result in
                the Test Explorer. Fluent assertions provides meaningful results when run.
                </p>
                <p>The Naming convention of unit testing is a s below
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Unit Testing Project - </b>This is simply called Unit Testing.</li>
                    <li><b>Project being tested - </b>This is a new folder called "UT.{Projectname}".</li>
                    <li><b>Class being tested - </b>A Class be created within the project folder called
                        "{ClassName}Tests". </li>
                    <li><b>Method being Tested - </b>a method should be created with the name
                        "{methodname}_{ReturnType}" this ensures all overloads can be tested independently.</li>
                </ol>
                The above naming convention allows a structure to the tests and indicates exactly what is being tested
                in the results making life easier for developers. If you are new to Unit Testing I would suggest you
                view a youtube video in conjunction with the examples in the start-template.UnitTesting project.
