                <p>The following assumptions have been made, These are :-
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 - </b>Has been installed.</li>
                    <li><b>Microssoft SQL Server - </b>Has been installed.</li>
                    <li><b>Microssoft SQL Server Management Studio - </b>Has been installed.</li>
                    <li>You are familiar with the installed software.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the solution is to provide a starting point for future projects the aim of this
                    solution is to save it as a template for Visual Studio so that template can then be used to create a
                    new solution with all the bells and whistles without the need to make any standard changes. That is
                    to say software has various default elements which have to be implemented everytime with the default
                    templates by creating a customised template this extra work can be eliminated. It is worth noting
                    however that this solution will not suit evrey situation and as a result it is advisable to review
                    the functionality and adapt it to your requirements as required.
                </p>
                <p>For more information on the solution see the solutions tab.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="solution" role="tabpanel">
                <p><b>Status - Done</b><br>Software essentially requires 4 distinct elements, using the concept of
                    separation of Responsibilities it is good practice to have a separate project for each
                    responsibility resulting in the following 2 projects per solution :-
                <ol>
                    <li><b>App Project - </b>This is the startup Project and deals with the main application set up
                        including Models Functionality & Views. </li><!--
                    <li><b>API Project - </b>This deals with database connectivity, and CRUD operations using ReSTful
                        Services.</li>
                    <li><b>Logging Project - </b>This Deals with all aspects of logging including connecting to the Log
                        Database. Global Exception Handling, Other log events which means that all logging in a solution
                        is consistant.</li>-->
                    <li><b>Unit Testing Project - </b>To Deal with all Unit Testing within the Project which is an
                        important element because these provide a quick reliable check to ensure the methods tested
                        remain in the Parameters of the specification.</li>
                </ol>
                It is worth noting that an alternative is to include the functionality into the "App project" However,
                it is common practice to enable 3rd parties to access the database using the API project as being an
                interface this keeps the database secure. Not forgetting that there can be different teams working on
                the different projects simultaneously without the risk of "stepping on each others toes" (To coin a
                phrase). Also, when the website is run it is necessary to load and render the project so if we have the
                app Project doing the bare minimum then this will at least give the perception of improved performance.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="use" role="tabpanel">
                <p>First, feel free to clone and use the project, having said that I would suggest that you ensure the project fully meets your needs and if not amend it to meet your needs,  then create a template not forgetting to keep everything up to date for security reasons. Also if you don't know how to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6xc5Jg5Sy8" target="_blank">clone</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNYC53m3Lw8" target="_blank">create a template</a> then simply click the links for a video guide.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="app" role="tabpanel">
                <p><b>Status - Done.<br>FrameWork - Models-Views-Controllers (MVC) Project</b><br>It is fair to say that the MVC framework can be used to do all the tasks required in a project having said that the purpose of the "App Project" is to act as a <b>start-up project and hub</b> so that everything goes through the app but elements such as database access, logging & testing are done by specialist projects as and when required which provides consistency throughout solutions and projects within the solution. The App project contains the Models which can be created from either an existing database or from code.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="api" role="tabpanel">
                <p><b>Status - To Do.</b><br><b>FrameWork - Web API Project</b><br>The purpose of the Application Programmable Interface is to provide a facility by which a request can be made to the database securely. Without giving access to the database or divulging its structure unnecessarily, meaning you are in control of the Data. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="log" role="tabpanel">
                <p><b>Status - To Do.</b><br>Logging has 3 main components these are :-
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Connecting to the logging Media - </b>This includes defining the logging database connection
                        string which if the database does not exist it will create the database and subsequently the
                        "Log" table automatically while remaining totally divorced from the main app meaning the log can
                        reside on a different server to the Data again ensuring data security.</li>
                    <li><b>Global Exception Handling - </b>This ensures that all Exceptions will be handled consistently
                        throughout the solution wherever the exception is thrown</li>
                    <li><b>Global Logging - </b>This again ensures that all the logging is consistent throughout the
                        solution. </li>
                </ol>The Logging project means that everything can be pre-defined and the development team only has to
                deal with making the log entries in the solution.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="utest" role="tabpanel">
                <p><b>Status - Done.<br>FrameWork - Xunit Project</b><br>In order to fully understand Unit Testing (UT) it is necessary to understand the basic principles of UT.  Testing has always been done in the Software development lifecycle UT is only one of the Later strategies <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>History of Testing </b>initially testing was done using Dry Runs (pen and paper) very monotonous, laborious and time-consuming, as a result not very efficient. This was later improved in an attempt to auromate the process be writing specific methods to call the relevant method and test the output.  This approach was the predecessor to UT as we know it.</li>
                        <li><b>Analogy of Software defences </b>it is reasonable to compare software protection with an animal such as a crustacion, shell-fish or insect. Which all have protective outer layers and soft (vulnerable) insides.  This strategy is also employed by the military for example armoured vehicles to protect the vulnerable service-personnel. The Job of the User Interface (UI) is to act as that hard exterior in order to protect the vulnerable Operating System (OS) this is where UT comes in.</li>
                        <li><b>Software Vulnerabilities </b>Unscrupulous programmers use various means to exploit software by using methods which are in line with computer rules but the software was not designed to deal with causing the software to crash providing a chink in the armour of the UI enabling the Software to be exploited,  Such common methods are SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, One-up One-down vulnerabilities to name but a few. As a result UT is a tool used to protect the software. This raisess the question how can we use UT to protect software <br> <ol>
                            <li><b>Specification </b>all methods to be tested should be defined in the specification as a result each test can be wrote before the method being tested so the test is wrote to the specification NOT the method.</li>
                            <li><b>Method </b>once the method has been wrote and complies with the test, The test can be revised by inspecting the source-code with a view to breaking the method (previously known as Testing to Destruction). All appropriate validation can be implemented as required in the method and test, tightening up any loose ends so to speak.</li>
                            <li><b>Example of validation </b>the functionality to add two integers is really straight forward or so you might think "number1 + number2" however it is possible that the equation will not work because the computer has a Maximum value so such validation could be done to ensure the calculation is correct by introducing a 3rd variable so "total = number1 + number2" the validation could then be "if (number2 != total - number1) throw exception" the test would be changed to ensure the appropriate exception is thrown.</li>
                        </ol></li>
                        <li><b>Balanced Approached - </b>Tests should be wrote for methods which originate in the product and are dynamic(Can be changed)
                        specification which outlines the parameters of the associated method. Only dynamic internal(Not external Libraries or Frameworks) methods should be tested.</li>
                        <li><b>Encourage Good Coding Practices - </b>Unit Tests should only be done on methods which are Testable (one unit of work meaning a method which in the past did several units of work then that method is not testable, however by breaking the method down into manageable components each component can be tested. As a result the quality of code is improved.</li>
                        <li><b>Expose Security Vulnerabilities - </b>The most common secutity vulnerability is the "one up, one down vulnerability" which in short enables code to be exploited when for example a loop does one too many or few iterations, if these can be exposed then the software is inherently more secure.</li>
                        <li><b>Expose newly introduced problems - </b> If a change causes a test to fail this draws attention to the change and means that both the test and change should be reviewwed as the test may be too strict or the change does in fact take the method outside of the specified parameters of the method meaning that potential issues are exposed. Whereby in the past this would have been missed.</li>
                    </ul> 
                    This Project approaches testing by having 2 Example Tests (1 Fact & 1 Theory) and is wired up to the app project it uses <a href="https://fluentassertions.com/introduction" target="_blank">Fluent Assertions</a> to define the criteria meaning that this is a good starting point for Unit Testing in any future project also don't forget to update the GlobalUsings.cs to include new projects and/or folders as required. To run you just have to "Run All Tests" from the "Test" menu and view the result in the Test Explorer. Fluent assertions provides meaningful results when run.
                </p>
                <p>The Naming convention of unit testing is a s below
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Unit Testing Project - </b>This is simply called Unit Testing.</li>
                    <li><b>Project being tested - </b>This is a new folder called "UT.{Projectname}".</li>
                    <li><b>Class being tested - </b>A Class be created within the project folder called
                        "{ClassName}Tests". </li>
                    <li><b>Method being Tested - </b>a method should be created with the name
                        "{methodname}_{ReturnType}" this ensures all overloads can be tested independently.</li>
                </ol>
                The above naming convention allows a structure to the tests and indicates exactly what is being tested
                in the results making life easier for developers. If you are new to Unit Testing I would suggest you
                view a youtube video in conjunction with the examples in the start-template.UnitTesting project.
